# LifeSaver

Tired of forgetting to save when closing [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama), and then praying for the backups to be there?

Well now you can finally escape this nightmare ðŸŽ‰

## How this extension works:
- The autosave timer for this extension is **the same as** the timer for pixelorama's backups (You would have to enable backups in preferences!)
- This extension backs up your sessions for upto 20 last sessions!
- The sessions (or any specific project from that session) can be restored from `File --> Restore a Past Session`
- You can also manually browse the backups using `Help --> Browse LifeSaver Backups`

Have Fun !!!
